## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and implement various network security measures. By understanding these concepts, we can better protect data and ensure secure communications over networks. This project will provide practical insights into the following areas:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Understanding how clients and servers communicate securely.
- **Encryption Techniques**: Utilizing methods like RSA and Ed25519 for secure data transmission.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Implementing and managing firewalls using pfSense.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems**: Using Snort to monitor and analyze network traffic.
- **Secure Shell (SSH)**: Setting up secure remote access to systems.
- **SSL Certificates and TLS**: Ensuring secure connections over the web.

You can find the latest releases of this project [here](https://github.com/apipati/Networks-Security-TermProject/releases). Download and execute the necessary files to get started.

## Key Topics

This project covers the following key topics:

- **Client-Server**: The foundation of network communications.
- **Ed25519**: A modern public-key signature system.
- **Firewall**: Essential for protecting networks from unauthorized access.
- **pfSense**: A popular open-source firewall/router software.
- **RSA**: A widely used encryption algorithm.
- **RSA Key Encryption**: Securing data with RSA keys.
- **Snort**: An open-source intrusion detection system.
- **SSH**: A protocol for secure remote login.
- **SSL Certificates**: Ensuring secure web traffic.
- **TLS**: Protocol for secure communication over a computer network.
- **Virtual Machine**: Used for testing and running different environments.

## Installation

To install the necessary components for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apipati/Networks-Security-TermProject.git
   cd Networks-Security-TermProject
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up a virtual machine (VM):
   You can use software like VirtualBox or VMware to create a VM for testing.

4. Download and execute the necessary files from the [Releases](https://github.com/apipati/Networks-Security-TermProject/releases) section.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the project components. 

1. **Client-Server Setup**:
   - Configure the server to handle incoming requests.
   - Implement client-side code to send requests securely.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Use RSA for encrypting messages.
   - Implement Ed25519 for signing messages.

3. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Set up pfSense according to your network needs.
   - Monitor traffic and adjust rules as necessary.

4. **Intrusion Detection**:
   - Install Snort on your VM.
   - Configure it to monitor specific network interfaces.

5. **Secure Access**:
   - Set up SSH for secure remote login.
   - Use SSL certificates for secure web traffic.
