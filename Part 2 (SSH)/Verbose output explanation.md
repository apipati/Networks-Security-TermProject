 `ssh -vvv -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_fedora ahmed@192.168.1.10`, with **detailed explanations**:

---

### 🔑 1. **Command and Identity**

```
ssh -vvv -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_fedora ahmed@192.168.1.10
```

* You're connecting via SSH to `192.168.1.10` as user `ahmed`.
* Using `-vvv` enables very verbose output for debugging.
* You're explicitly specifying the identity file (`id_ed25519_fedora`) for key-based authentication.

---

### 📜 2. **Configuration Files Are Read**

```
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/20-systemd-ssh-proxy.conf
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/50-redhat.conf
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config
```

* SSH reads system-wide configuration files (`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, etc.).
* These files contain default client settings like preferred ciphers, key exchange algorithms, etc.
* Your host matched the `final all` rule in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/50-redhat.conf`.

---

### 🌐 3. **Connection Initiation**

```
debug1: Connecting to 192.168.1.10 [192.168.1.10] port 22.
debug1: Connection established.
```

* SSH attempts to connect to `192.168.1.10` on port `22`.
* The TCP connection is successfully established.

---

### 🔐 4. **Identity and Version Info**

```
debug1: identity file /home/ahmed/.ssh/id_ed25519_fedora type 3
debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.9
debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_9.9p1 Debian-3
```

* Your client is using the specified **Ed25519 private key**.
* Both client and server are running compatible versions of the SSH protocol (2.0).

---

### 🧩 5. **Authentication Initialization**

```
debug1: Authenticating to 192.168.1.10:22 as 'ahmed'
```

* Starts the authentication process as user `ahmed`.

---

### 🏷️ 6. **Host Key Verification**

```
debug1: Server host key: ssh-ed25519 SHA256:4nQYR5Y...
debug1: Host '192.168.1.10' is known and matches the ED25519 host key.
```

* SSH verifies the server’s **public host key**.
* It's already stored in your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, confirming the identity of the server.
* No host key warning appears — this is a **secure connection**.

---

### 🔄 7. **Key Exchange (KEX)**

```
debug1: kex: algorithm: curve25519-sha256
debug1: kex: host key algorithm: ssh-ed25519
debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY received
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent/received
```

* Both sides agree on a **key exchange algorithm** (`curve25519-sha256`) and **host key algorithm** (`ssh-ed25519`).
* They exchange temporary keys securely using ECDH.
* `NEWKEYS` messages indicate the switch to **encrypted communication**.

---

### 🛡️ 8. **Server Features Advertised**

```
debug1: kex_ext_info_client_parse: server-sig-algs=<ssh-ed25519,...>
```

* The server shares additional capabilities (e.g., supported signature algorithms).
* This allows the client to choose compatible algorithms for further authentication.

---

### 🔐 9. **Authentication Service Starts**

```
debug2: service_accept: ssh-userauth
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received
```

* SSH is now ready to authenticate the user via methods like:
  
  * public key
  * password
  * GSSAPI, etc.
